    <p1> I was born in Ecuador on April 18th, 2001. I grew up in Queens
    with my mom, dad, and 2 younger siblings. I'm a student at CityTech,
    majoring in Emerging Media Technology. I have an associates degree in
    Applied Sciences for Music Production and am currently working to get
    my Bachelors degree. My career goal is to work on sound design for video
    games and films. </p1>
    <br>
    <p2>Over the years, I have done a variety of performances and have worked
    on many different projects, both musical and visual. While in high school,
    I participated in a variety of events, one of my most memorable being Bayside's
    2018 S!ng production. While in college I found myself doing more technical and
    behind the scenes work for sound. I've worked with a wide range of sound equipment
    such as Doby Atmos & Audinate Dante. I've worked on video and audio recording as well as field recording and
    sound design for film. Some of my favorite past projects include, field recording, and live stage mixing.</p2>
    <br>
    <p3>On my free time, I love to work on music. I play piano and guitar, and
    enjoy writing and composing original songs. Check out some of my past academic and personal projects
